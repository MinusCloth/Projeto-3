<h1 align="center"> Customer Score Analysis in Banking: Automating Classification Models with Python</h1>

## üöÄ Introduction
In the realm of banking, assessing customer creditworthiness is crucial for informed decision-making. This project employs Python to analyze a dataset of 100,000 customers, aiming to automate the process of evaluating customer scores. By preprocessing data and training classification models, we seek to streamline credit assessments and uncover pivotal factors influencing customer creditworthiness.

## üåê Functionalities:
- Importing the Dataset: Imports the dataset using the pandas library and visualizes the information.
- Dataset Treatment: Checks and treats empty values, and converts text columns into numerical values for classification model usage.
- Classification Models: Splits the dataset into training and testing sets, imports and trains Decision Tree and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models, and evaluates the accuracy of each model.
- Conclusion: Presents the project results, including the accuracy of the models and the important features for defining the customer's score.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Useds:
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## üå± Conclusion and Final Considerations
This project has demonstrated the effectiveness of automating repetitive tasks using Python, providing an efficient approach to handling large volumes of data. The analysis of customer score in a bank illustrates how applying classification algorithms can assist in decision-making, such as loan approval and credit assessment, based on accurate predictions. By completing the project, it was possible to identify the most suitable classification model, as well as the most important features in defining the customer's score. These conclusions highlight the importance of data analysis and process automation in improving the efficiency and accuracy of banking operations.
